INSTALL
=======

To install this layout:

1. Identify your 'xkeyboard' directory. In my distro, it is
   `/usr/share/X11/xkb`.  I will call it `$XKBDIR`.

2. Substitute `$XKBDIR/symbols/es` with the one provided.

3. Modify next files, adding 'sporax' appropriately:

  - `$XKBDIR/rules/base.lst`
  - `$XKBDIR/rules/base.xml`
  - `$XKBDIR/rules/evdev.lst`
  - `$XKBDIR/rules/evdev.xml`

4. Restart X server.

In the 'scripts' directory, you may find some useful scripts to help you
get this work done.
